# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was develope a command line application that when running, prompts a series of questions about building a work team. Once the questions are answered the information is printed and formatted to an html file containing each employee's information on individual cards. Now the user can easily build a work team just by answering a few questions. While working on this project I learned more about how to use objects, Test Driven Development and generally how to get dynamic HTML from JavaScript and on to a file.

## Installation

Just open the index.js and using Node, write node index.js in the command line.
